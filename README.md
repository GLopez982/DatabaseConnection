This program utilizes multi-threading to simulate two vendor purchases of products available within a warehouse. The purchased amount and product are randomized and updated through MySQL to a database that contains the stored information. The information is then displayed after the purchase to show the remaining inventory. This project includes concepts of Polymorphism, Multi-Threading, and database connectivity including connections, statements, and prepared statements for querying the MySQL database.  

the output will be provided in the terminal and consists of the purchases made by the threads and the available product after the update.


connection requires mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar or higher
